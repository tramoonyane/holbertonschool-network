OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. These layers, from the lowest to the highest, are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

LAN (Local Area Network)
A LAN is a network of interconnected computers within a limited geographical area, such as a single building or campus. It is commonly used for sharing resources like files, printers, and internet connections among devices in close proximity.

Typical Usage: Facilitates local communication, file sharing, and resource sharing among connected devices.
Typical Geographical Size: Limited to a specific location, such as a home, office, or campus.
WAN (Wide Area Network)
A WAN is a network that covers a broad area, connecting multiple LANs and other networks across cities, countries, or continents.

Typical Usage: Enables long-distance communication and data exchange between geographically separated networks.
Typical Geographical Size: Spans a large geographical area, possibly covering regions, countries, or continents.
Internet
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and networks, providing a vast array of information and services.

IP Address
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network. It serves two main purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing.

Types of IP Addresses
IPv4: 32-bit address, expressed as four sets of decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
IPv6: 128-bit address, expressed as a hexadecimal string, developed to address the limitations of IPv4 and accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the Internet.
Localhost
Localhost refers to the loopback network interface, typically designated by the IP address 127.0.0.1. It allows a device to access its network services without going through a physical network.

Subnet
A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network, helping to improve network performance and security by organizing devices into smaller, manageable groups.

IPv6 Creation
IPv6 was created to address the depletion of available IPv4 addresses and to provide a larger address space to accommodate the increasing number of connected devices on the Internet.

TCP/UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two widely used transport layer protocols in the OSI model.

Main Difference Between TCP and UDP
TCP: Connection-oriented, reliable, ensures data integrity through acknowledgment and retransmission mechanisms.
UDP: Connectionless, faster but less reliable, suitable for real-time applications where some data loss is acceptable.
Port
A port is a communication endpoint in a network, identified by a numerical value. It helps direct incoming data to the appropriate application or service.

Port Numbers
SSH: 22
HTTP: 80
HTTPS: 443
Tool/Protocol for Device Connectivity Check
Ping is a commonly used tool/protocol to check if a device is connected to a network. It sends an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request and waits for a response from the target device.
